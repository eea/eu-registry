- need the countryId for all look-up tables
- ProductionInstallation.xml: changed the order of elements, pointGeometry
  moved before installationName
- ProductionFacility.xml: * moved geometry before facilityName
  * removed parentCompanyName, added parentCompany (which includes parentCompanyName and
    parentCompanyURL)

previous reported year = reporting year from xml minus 1 (for reporting year 2018 previous year is 2017)

3.1
Text from QA/QC document: "All inspireIds within a single XML submission will be compared to the inspireIds in the master
database, for the same reporting country. The amount of inspireIds, found in both the submission
and the master database, will be evaluated in the context of the total amount of inspireIds
in the XML submission. The number of new IDs within a single XML submission should not
exceed 50% of the total number of inspireIds, and ideally be less than 20%."

Current implementation:
compares currently reported inspire Ids with Ids from previous reported year,
for all four feature types

4.5
Fuzzy matching will be performed between the XML submission and the master database
on the location and siteName attributes independently for each ProductionSite with different
InspireIds. An appropriate matching algorithm will be chosen relative to the data considered
in each respective attribute (e.g. Levenshtein distance for attributes which contain a
character string). Such algorithms need to be geared towards identifying not only similarity
but also potential typing errors. The average similarity across the attributes considered
will be compared to an appropriate total similarity threshold, representing a non-acceptable
degree of similarity. Such testing will exclude exact duplicates due to the pre-requisite of
different InspireIds (e.g. the same facility being reported between years).
The exact algorithms chosen and the thresholds will be evaluated for effectiveness in
testing phases of the EU Registry.

Current implementation:
compares currently reported location+siteName with location+siteName with different
InspireIds from previous reported year

4.6 - same as 4.5 but compares geometry, parentCompanyName, EPRTRAnnexIActivity and facilityName

4.7 - same as 4.5 but compares pointGeometry, IEDAnnexIActivity and installationName

4.8 - same as 4.5 but compares plantType and installationPartName

4.9
The check will analyse existing reported inspireIds for ProductionFacilities reported within
the submission, if reported in the previous year. These will be compared to the facility’s
associated site in the master database and the current associated site within the submission.
The ProdunctionFaciltiy should reference the same site as the previous reporting year,
as indicated by the continuity of the same InspireId for the associated site.
All inspireIds present in the master database must also be found in the XML submission
except where the corresponding inspireIds for all associated production facilities have
the value ‘decommissioned’ for the attribute status in the previous reporting year.

Current implementation:
For ProductionFacilities we check if hostingSite attribute is the same in the reporting xml
and previous reporting year

Note:
"All inspireIds present in the master database must also be found in the XML submission
except where the corresponding inspireIds for all associated production facilities have
the value ‘decommissioned’ for the attribute status in the previous reporting year."

This is checked in 4.10, should we verify this here too?

4.10
The check will compare existing reported inspireIds contained in the master database
with newly reported inspireIds. All inspireIds present in the master database should also
be found in the XML submission except where the corresponding inspireId for the
ProductionFacility has the value ‘decommissioned’ or ‘not regulated’ for the attribute
status in the previous reporting year.

Current implementation:
inspireIds from database from previous reporting year are checked if they exists in the
current report. If they do not exists, we check the statusType attribute and if it has other
value than ‘decommissioned’ or ‘not regulated’ it is flagged as blocking error.

4.11 - same as 4.10 but for ProductionInstallation

4.12 - same as 4.10 but for ProductionInstallationPart

5.6
The coordinates for all spatial objects within an XML submission will be compared to the
spatial object of the same InspireId within the master database. Coordinates should remain
constant over time, but it is recognised that coordinates may seldom change in relation to
improved accuracy. The differences in coordinates between the XML submission and the master
database will be evaluated based on the linear distance invoked by the change. A distance
between the two coordinates of 10-30 m may be considered as coordinate refinement, however
distances above the upper bound of this range but less than a distance of 100 m are considered
as unlikely and represent significant change. A distance above 100 m is deemed as introducing
nonsensical data into the master database

Current implementation:
We calculate the distance (in meters) between the coordinates from previous reported year
and from current report (see criterias from above)
for ProductionFacility the act-core:geometry attribute,
for ProductionInstallation the pf:pointGeometry, for ProductionInstallationPart the pf:pointGeometry
and for ProductionSite the location attribute

6.2
The EPRTRAnnexIActivity ‘mainActivity’ attribute of for all ProductionFacilities within
an XML submission will be compared to the ProductionFacility of the same InspireId within
the master database. The EPRTRAnnexIActivityType ‘mainActivity’should remain constant over
time and seldom change, particularly between activity group (the activity group is denoted
by the first digit of the EPRTRAnnexIActivityType Id)

Current implementation:
Compares mainActivity atribute for ProductionFacilities, previous reporting year
and current report

6.4
The IEDAnnexIActivity attribute of for all ProductionInstallations within an XML
submission will be compared to the ProductionInstallation of the same InspireId
within the master database. The IEDAnnexIActivityType should remain constant over time,
and seldom change, particularly between activity group (the activity group is denoted by
the first digit of the IEDAnnexIActivityType Id).

Current implementation:
Compares IEDAnnexIActivity atribute for ProductionInstallations, previous reporting year
and current report

7.5
In a single XML submission the StatusType of all spatial objects will be queried.
If the StatusType is populated with the term ‘functional’, the StatusType for the
same spatial object in the previous report year must not be ‘decommissioned’.

Current implementation:
compares statusType attribute for ProductionFacilities, ProductionInstallations and
ProductionInstallationParts, previous reporting year with the current report

9.3
The dateOfGranting attribute will be compared against a lookup table detailing the
previous dateOfGranting for all ProductionInstallations. If a change in this date is
identified, the permitURL attributes will also be compared. The permitURL should be
different to one another.

Current implementation:
dateOfGranting and permitURL are compared with previous reporting year.

10.5
The derogation attribute of for all ProductionInstallationParts within an XML submission
will be compared to the ProductionInstallationPart of the same InspireId within the master
database. If ‘Article 33’ is given within the master database, the attribute value should
also be ‘Article 33’.  Once the period described above has passed, this check will be made
obsolete.

Current implementation:
compares derogations attribute, previous year with current report

10.6
he derogation attribute for all ProductionInstallationParts within an XML submission will
be compared to the ProductionInstallationPart of the same InspireId within the master database.
If ‘Article 35’ is given within the master database, the attribute value should also
be ‘Article 35’.  Once the period described above has passed, this check will be made obsolete.

Current implementation:
compares derogations attribute, previous year with current report

10.7
The derogation attribute of for all ProductionInstallationParts within an XML submission
will be compared to the ProductionInstallationPart of the same InspireId within the master
database. If ‘Article 32’ is given within the master database, the attribute value should
also be ‘Article 32’. This check will be made obsolete once the period described above has passed

Current implementation:
compares derogations attribute, previous year with current report


13.4
The nameOfFeature attribute within the FeatureName data type of all spatial objects within
an XML submission will be compared to the name of the spatial object of the same inspireId
within the master database. Names should remain constant over time

Current implementation:
compares nameOfFeature attribute (for all four feature types), previous year with current report
